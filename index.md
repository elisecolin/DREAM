## Welcome to DREAM Pages


### Presentation

DREAM is a project for studying IA tools for remote sensing in Onera

The aim of the project DREAM is to promote the development of new algorithms for automatic processing in artificial intelligence in the specific context of the exploitation of remote sensing data. More specifically, the specific context of access to remote sensing data and the related issues of unsupervised deep learning, as well as the specificity of the sensors and physics at the origin of the signal contained in the images will be taken into account.
